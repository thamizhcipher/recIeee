                  Since the inception of REC in 1997, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering has been continuously making progress in teaching and R&D activities. Initially commencing with an intake of 60 students, currently the intake is 300 seats. The Post Graduate programme viz. M.E. - Computer Science and Engineering was introduced in the year 2004-05 and in 2006 the Department was recognized as a Collaborative Research Centre by Anna University to offer Ph.D. programmes. The Department is accredited by NBA and Industries. 
                    The Department has been maintaining an active interaction with the industries particularly with the Computer Society of India. The IT major Tata Consultancy Services has accredited the college for faculty and students development programmes, campus interview etc. The Department has entered an MoU with IBM, Infosys and U.S. Technologies for software training and Faculty Development Programmes, besides R&D activities. Many of the students are well placed in leading software companies such as TCS, Infosys, Satyam, Polaris etc.

                  This ieee mainly focuses towards the evolving requirement for intelligent computing and communication. This conference aims to present an integrated platform for advanced and multi-disciplinary research towards novelties that may be realistic to offer genuine solution to wide-ranging glitches in society, environment and industries. The Scope is also stretched out in the direction of deployment of emerging computational and knowledge transfer approaches, optimizing solutions in varied disciplines of science and technology. 
                    InterNational Conference on Computing and Data Science (ICCDS-2023) is the platform where academicians and industry research present their contemporary findings so that new inclinations and thoughts on computing and communication can be explored. The key objective is to offer the participants all over the nation to share their ideas and experience with peers. In addition to this, the conference will also help the participants in establishing a research network which will help them in their career path.
